I focused on the navigation bar which is responsive and it is placed to the bottom when the max-weigth is iqual or higher than 750px, also to the gallerywork which shows the projects in a slider. All the others windows have just generic text (lorem Ipsum)

I follow as support the following tutorials:

  and got the icons and JavaScript slider from:
